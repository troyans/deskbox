![fresh-chat-alternative.png](./img/fresh-chat-alternative.png)

It is a task to find top Freshchat Alternatives for your business, as we have a highly saturated market. Here, we have jotted down the option that you can explore as best Freshchat alternatives offer all that it takes in a live chat support.

However, before we elaborate on the list of alternatives, one question still has to be answered – Why would you search for an alternative in place of freshchat? In fact, this question warrants its own section. Ok, let's start over.

## **What Is Freshchat?**

Freshchat is an effortless conversation engagement software that also plays a role in live chat support by Freshworks, helping businesses enhance the quality of customer service they provide. A simple machine learning-powered automated chat technology for businesses to engage with customers and provide live help. It features chat rooms and stores a record of the chats to monitor customer discussions on its protected server.

## **Why do you look for a Freshchat alternative?**

It is against this backdrop that we need to talk about the purpose of why you should even be searching for Freshchat competitors and alternatives, before going any further. So, here are a couple of reasons why the majority prefer going for Freshchat alternatives while you should too.

**Limited Integration Options:** It is also not the best alternative if you are looking for a tool that will easily fit into your CRM and business ecosystem. It supports only FreshDesk, no third-party integration.

**Issues in Automation:** Not as much automation is seamless compared to Freshchat rivals and the range of integrations are shallow. Sometimes It is too complicated to use its functionality and has very few features in it.

**Unpredictable Minor Bugs:** There are some little bugs in the tool. For instance, not offering a wide range of GIFs, timing and accuracy issues around responses, messages with typos in the message templates or lack proper response punctuation marks. And, it also allows you to block & delete messaging.

## **9 FreshChat Alternatives at 2024**

### **1. DeskBox**

[Deskbox](https://deskbox.co/) offers an affordable alternative to ChatBot by taking a different approach to customer support. Instead of competing with existing live chat platforms, Deskbox works alongside them, currently integrating with Intercom as an alternative to Intercom's FIN chatbot.

### **Customization**

With Deskbox, you can customize the look of your chat widget to match your brand’s identity, giving it a unique and personal touch.

Deskbox seamlessly integrates with existing customer support tools like Intercom, making it a cost-effective way to add AI capabilities to your current system. While other AI chatbots can be pricey, Deskbox offers a more affordable solution, managing routine inquiries while letting your human agents handle more complex issues.

Currently, Deskbox integrates only with Intercom, but there are plans to expand to other platforms like Zendesk Live Chat and Crisp in the future.
