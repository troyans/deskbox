It is a task to find top Freshchat Alternatives for your business, as we have a highly saturated market. Here, we have jotted down the option that you can explore as best Freshchat alternatives offer all that it takes in a live chat support.

However, before we elaborate on the list of alternatives, one question still has to be answered – Why would you search for an alternative in place of freshchat? In fact, this question warrants its own section. Ok, let's start over.

## **What Is Freshchat?**

Freshchat is an effortless conversation engagement software that also plays a role in live chat support by Freshworks, helping businesses enhance the quality of customer service they provide. A simple machine learning-powered automated chat technology for businesses to engage with customers and provide live help. It features chat rooms and stores a record of the chats to monitor customer discussions on its protected server.

## **Why do you look for a Freshchat alternative?**

It is against this backdrop that we need to talk about the purpose of why you should even be searching for Freshchat competitors and alternatives, before going any further. So, here are a couple of reasons why the majority prefer going for Freshchat alternatives while you should too.

**Limited Integration Options:** It is also not the best alternative if you are looking for a tool that will easily fit into your CRM and business ecosystem. It supports only FreshDesk, no third-party integration.

**Issues in Automation:** Not as much automation is seamless compared to Freshchat rivals and the range of integrations are shallow. Sometimes It is too complicated to use its functionality and has very few features in it.

**Unpredictable Minor Bugs:** There are some little bugs in the tool. For instance, not offering a wide range of GIFs, timing and accuracy issues around responses, messages with typos in the message templates or lack proper response punctuation marks. And, it also allows you to block & delete messaging.
