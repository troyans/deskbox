Talking about the implementation of chatbots in boosting digital marketing, there will be a lot that can be discussed. Chatbot simulations that work like humans allow these machines to answer a hundred or even a thousand questions without stopping. Sales and marketing using chatbots is a good, fast, and cheap step. 

As in previous discussions, ***chatbots for marketing*** bring many benefits to a company. Let's just say, chatbots replace the position of customer service, which is required to serve customers all day long. Instead, chatbots can be active 24/7, providing maximum convenience for customers. So, the next question, ***how can chatbots be used in marketing?*** Check out the following review!

## **How Can Chatbots Be Used in Marketing?**

In the ever-growing digital era, the use of artificial intelligence is commonplace in business. The existence of chatbots can be said to be the most popular current trend. This chatbot is used through a messaging interface, where customers talk to a machine as if they were talking to a human. The massive use of chatbots has made it a 'buzzword in the industry'. This embedding is not without reason, here's how chatbots play an important role in digital marketing!

### **Save Time and Cost Effectively**

Chatbots are an investment for the future that can be continuously used in the world of marketing. Have you ever wondered ***how can chatbots change marketing and sales?*** Well, with a technology system that is active non-stop 24/7, the chatbot displays real-time responses from customers. The existence of chatbots is very profitable, because it reduces the funds and time used to serve customer wishes one by one. As a result, chatbots will save money. It's as easy as that.

The results of a study show that in 2023, chatbots have delivered up to $11 billion in cost savings. This number is a calculation from various sectors, such as the health industry, retail, and banking. When compared to hiring a staff as a customer service, it will cost a lot of money. Because, they need training, insurance packages, transportation fees, and even supporting infrastructure.

### **Enhance the Quality of Customer Service**

Perhaps, the most valuable change a chatbot has made to a business or company is the quality of customer service. Customer service is a tiring job, because you have to answer endless user questions and complaints. The simple reason why chatbots are a solution is: to solve customer problems, including:

- There is no 24 hour customer service line available
- Long response time to questions or complaints from customers
- The call center is always busy and cannot be contacted
- Improper attitude or conflict with the agent

### **Personalizing Scalability**

Scalability and increasing workload within a company can be threats. Increasing customer activity can complicate the situation. So a company might hire new people, or lay off staff who it feels are less competent in their field. These changes will put pressure on human resources departments.

Implementing chatbots will really help the process of increasing scalability, of course with lower costs and an easier process. For the record, the following things must be considered when increasing scalability with the help of chatbots

- Continue adding some features that are needed by customers, because that is what will make them stick around and continue to subscribe
- Introducing the chatbot and its specific department. Remember, the narrower the scope of questions asked to the chatbot, the more effective the interaction with customers will be, and the more accurate the information provided
- Personalize interactions with users. Make sure the bot doesn't just answer FAQs according to a template. Personalizing chatbot interactions will make customers feel like their needs are being met by a company.

### **Nurture Leads**

Chatbots play an important role in generating high-quality business leads. Conversations with chatbots are very easy, especially if we look in depth at people's habits of preferring to send text messages rather than making or receiving calls from customer service. In generating and nurturing leads, companies can build and organize chatbots like this:

- Offer promotions and discounts for first-time visitors
- Engage customers through quizzes or product recommendations
- Offers subscriptions and provides useful information
- Make an appointment with a live agent

### **Collecting Customers’s Data**

Why is collecting customer data considered important in starting a business? The answer is that, with this data, companies can understand consumer desires, behaviors and concerns about a product. Information related to this data is very meaningful in developing demand strategies and generating prospects for a business. The following are universal types of data that can be collected with the help of chatbots:

- Customer personas
- Customer desires
- Customer concerns about certain products
- Language preferences and choices
- Demographics

So, how do companies use this to get important data related to customers? You can use the following steps:

- Bots can collect names, emails, contact information, and other personal info;
- Ask a customer about specific questions related products and services;
- Organize quizzes and distribute polls

As a note, don't rush into asking questions. Questions can be asked when the customer is comfortable enough surfing the website, Messenger, or any application owned by a company or business. In an era where personal information is prone to being stolen, customers certainly will not provide their personal information quickly. Being patient in communicating and continuing to build customer trust are the keys. Make sure that the chatbot provides the best service, goods, and services to customers.

### **Chatbots As A Reminder**

Have you ever heard the term 'abandon cart'? Yep, this term is popular among online business owners. Abandon cart means that buyers only put the items they want into the shopping cart, then forget about them. In 2020-2021, the percentage of abandoned carts on e-commerce platforms reached 85.6%. In this condition, businesses use chatbots as a reminder or alarm.
