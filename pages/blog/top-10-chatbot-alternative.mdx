If you are looking for a chatbot on your website or in your app then ChatBot may be what comes to your mind. ChatBot is an AI-based chatbot software that helps you automate and scale up a lot of tasks on your website with the help of its Help Desk, Live Chat and other impressive tools.

However, more effective tools come at the cost of using them in large amounts. Further, ChatBot is limited by subscription to apply its premium features like buttons and many chats at the same time as well having a different paid gateway for live chat access which comes off really expensive.

It was neither the first on the market nor is it the best chatbot you can find now. Especially when you look at the prices of their individual parts. If all you need is a simple conversational chatbot, one of the alternatives to ChatBot.


Let’s take a look at the ChatBot service and features itself.

## **When might you replace ChatBot with another alternative?**

The people communicate with computer programs, as if they were communicating via instant messaging service. They can also offer automated tasks or information. In place, you can use chatbots with messaging platforms or as website live chats. For example, visitors to your online store can ask questions about products using a chat icon 24/7 and receive automatic responses from your ecommerce сhatbot.


ChatBot  can assist you in improving this situation and keep customers satisfied. On the whole, there is a complete ecosystem of SaaS products for customer service by this company (ChatBot, LiveChat and HelpDesk) to name a few.

But, they are all paid tools. You have to use multiple modules — all of which require separate subscriptions. You would have to pay nearly $150 a month in order to access features beyond just button actions. And that only gets you a small number of conversations as well. Then there is the live chat which needs a LiveChat subscription and if you want to provide it as an AI virtual assistant solution mixed with human agents, then that requires buying a separate feature.

Many of the competitors to ChatBot allow you unlimited chatbots and conversations for a fraction of that price. They also throw in a complimentary free live chat. There is no need to spend such a huge amount on chatbots, look for viable options in the market like DeskBox before actually considering it. Here are the 10 best ChatBot alternatives for you in case this is not fulfilling your requirements.

## **1. Deskbox**
